# Foody AI 🍽️  
Personalized Mobile AI Agent for Discovering Top Restaurants Nearby

## 🚀 Overview
Foody AI is an autonomous mobile AI agent built using the Droidrun framework that helps users discover famous restaurants near their location, along with their ratings and popular food items, based on the user’s preferred food type.

The agent operates directly on real mobile applications such as Google Maps or food delivery apps, demonstrating true mobile-native agentic behavior.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Finding a good restaurant nearby is often time-consuming. Users must:
- Open multiple apps
- Manually search and filter
- Read ratings and reviews
- Guess popular dishes

This becomes even harder when users want a specific type of food.

---

## 💡 Solution
Foody AI solves this by acting as an intelligent mobile agent that:
- Takes the user’s food preference as input by the voice command
- Searches for restaurants nearby
- Filters results based on cuisine
- Extracts ratings and popular dishes

All actions are executed autonomously on a mobile device using Droidrun.

## 🧠 Agentic Behavior
Foody AI is a closed-loop AI agent, not a scripted automation.

### Agent Workflow:
1. Observation – Reads mobile UI elements
2. Reasoning – Decides next steps using an LLM
3. Action – Interacts with mobile apps
4. Feedback – Verifies results and adapts

## 🎯 Personalized Food Preference
Users can specify a preferred food type, such as:
- Biryani
- South Indian
- Chinese
- Pizza
- Vegan / Pure Veg

The agent dynamically adapts its search strategy and decision-making based on this input.
